# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the **RAGHub** project! We appreciate your support in making this a valuable resource for the community.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from everyone. If you'd like to add a new framework, project, or resource, follow these steps to get started:

1. **Fork this repository**.
2. **Create a new branch**: Use a descriptive name for your branch. For example: `git checkout -b add-framework-yourname`.
3. **Make your changes**: Update the appropriate section in the `README.md` by following the table format below.
4. **Update the Table of Contents (TOC)**: If you are adding a new category or section, make sure to add a link to the TOC.
5. **Submit a pull request (PR)**: Once your changes are complete, submit a PR to the main branch for review.

### Contribution Format

#### Adding a new resource (Frameworks, projects etc.):

If you're adding a resource, please insert a new row into the correct category table in the README.md file, using the following format:

```md
| Framework Name | Description (max 80 char) | Website link | Github link | Github stars | Last activity on Github |
```

Example:

```md
| LangChain | A framework for building applications with LLMs. | [Website](https://langchain.com) | [Github](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) | 93.2k | 9h ago |
```

If you don't see a category that fits your resource, feel free to create a new category by adding it both to the README.md and updating the Table of Contents accordingly.

### Updating the Table of Contents (TOC)

If you're adding a new category or section, please ensure that you update the Table of Contents to reflect your changes. Use the following format to add new categories:

```md
- [New Category Name](#new-category-name)
```

For example, if you're adding a new section called RAG Best Practices, add it like this in the TOC:

```md
- [RAG Best Practices](#rag-best-practices)
```

### Final Steps

1. Ensure that your changes follow the format provided and are consistent with the current style.
2. Double-check that all links work and point to the correct URLs.
3. Submit your pull request. We will review it and provide feedback if needed.
