# RAGHub: A Community for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Frameworks

Welcome to **RAGHub**, a living collection of frameworks, projects, and resources in the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ecosystem. This is a **community-driven project for [r/RAG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/)**, where we aim to catalog the rapid growth of RAG tools and projects.

With new frameworks popping up every day, it’s easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer number of options. How do you manage it all? Each day, it feels like a new tool emerges, and choosing the right one is becoming more of an art than a science. Is the framework from three months ago still relevant? Or was it just hype, rehashing old concepts with a fresh look?

**RAGHub exists to help you stay ahead**. By contributing to this community resource, you can track, share, and discuss the latest RAG frameworks and projects, while helping others navigate the constantly shifting landscape.

## Why RAGHub?

- **Frameworks**: Track the latest and most relevant RAG frameworks.
- **Projects**: Explore open-source projects implementing RAG methodologies.
- **Sites and Resources**: Discover helpful articles, tutorials, and guides.
