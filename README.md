# RAGHub: A Community for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Frameworks

Welcome to **RAGHub**, a living collection of **new and emerging frameworks, projects, and resources** in the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** ecosystem. This is a **community-driven project for [r/RAG](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rag/)**, where we aim to catalog the rapid growth of RAG tools and projects that are pushing the boundaries of the field.

Each day, it feels like a new tool or framework emerges, and choosing the right one is becoming more of an art than a science. Is the framework from three months ago still relevant? Or was it just hype, rehashing old concepts with a fresh look? **RAGHub exists to help you stay ahead of these changes**, providing a platform for the latest innovations in RAG.

### Looking for Proven or Mainstream RAG Frameworks?

If you're looking for **proven, mainstream RAG frameworks and techniques**, check out the excellent repository by Nir Diamant: [RAG Techniques](https://github.com/NirDiamant/RAG_Techniques). This repository focuses on more established tools and methods that have already gained traction in the community.
